# wasm-interop
Testbed for figuring out how to combine AssemblyScript and Rust code into a single WASM blob

## Goals

1. Be able to use a Rust library in AssemblyScript and produce one final wasm blob.

1.1). Another way around would be nice too/is the same problem most likely, but I reckon that Rust libraries and AssemblyScript glue is a more useful and real-world use case.

2. Create a Cosmwasm contract from Rust and AssemblyScript.

2.1. That seems to be just 1. but with some extra imports and exports.

## Possible approaches

See tracking issues. There are a couple of ways by which we can try this, from linking, module imports, cross-compiles, and most likely more.

## Discord/Socials?

Not atm. See the GitHub discussion tab. That makes it the easiest to contribute as well as catch up on discussions.

## State?

Just getting started. Expect nothing yet, hope for awesomeness.
